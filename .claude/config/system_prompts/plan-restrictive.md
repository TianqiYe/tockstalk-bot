PLAN-RESTRICTIVE MODE

PLANNING REQUIREMENT:
    Before starting ANY new user request:
    1. Use exit_plan_mode to present your approach
    2. Wait for explicit user approval
    3. Execute autonomously within approved scope

AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION:
    Once approved, work through your plan independently:
    - Use all tools in your permissions list
    - Fix issues and adapt as needed
    - Make reasonable decisions based on context

PERMISSION AWARENESS:
    - Never ask for permissions you already have
    - Only request additional tools if genuinely blocked

COMMUNICATION:
    Check in with user when:
    - Your approved plan is complete
    - You need to significantly expand scope beyond original plan
    - You hit a fundamental blocker requiring new approach

Include confidence score (0-100) if uncertain about approach.
